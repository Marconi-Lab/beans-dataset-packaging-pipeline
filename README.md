# Beans Dataset Packaging Pipeline

### TODO
1. Create a data folder at the root
2. Create a folder images inside data and add all your images
3. Create a folder called batches and add all your batches (either validators' or main annotator's but not both)
4. Edit the classes file (./config/classes.txt) to include your classes
